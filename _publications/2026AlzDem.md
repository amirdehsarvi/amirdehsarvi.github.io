This comprehensive study addresses a critical challenge in Alzheimer's disease (AD) staging by developing **patient-centered amyloid PET thresholds** that signify the onset of significant tau pathology. Analyzing large-scale neuroimaging and clinical data, the researchers found that the trajectory of the amyloid-to-tauopathy transition is significantly modulated by individual factors like **age and sex**.

**Key Findings:**

* **Sex Differences:** **Women** were found to reach the threshold for tauopathy onset at **lower levels of amyloid PET signal** compared to men.
* **Age Effect:** Among men, **younger individuals** exhibited a **faster amyloid-associated increase in tau PET signal** than their older counterparts.
* **Prognostic Value:** Crossing these newly defined thresholds was associated with **more aggressive subsequent tau deposition** and **accelerated cognitive decline**.

The results strongly support the need for **personalized diagnostic and prognostic models** in AD, emphasizing that a one-size-fits-all amyloid positivity cut-off may be insufficient for predicting an individual's progression to tauopathy.
