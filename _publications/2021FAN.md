excerpt: 'This study examines whether temporal characteristics in a collaborative referencing task are associated with cognitive function and the volumes of brain regions involved in speech production and known to be reduced in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer&#39;s pathology. We also explored the discriminative ability of the temporal speech measures for the classification of mild cognitive impairement and Alzheimer&#39;s disease.'

This study examines whether temporal characteristics in a collaborative referencing task are associated with cognitive function and the volumes of brain regions involved in speech production and known to be reduced in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer&#39;s pathology. We also explored the discriminative ability of the temporal speech measures for the classification of mild cognitive impairement and Alzheimer&#39;s disease.
