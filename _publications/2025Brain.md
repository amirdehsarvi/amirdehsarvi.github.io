This study explores the relationship between fibrillar tau pathology and white matter degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. The findings suggest that tau accumulation in the cortex is linked to lower white matter volume and faster white matter volume loss in connected regions, indicating a unidirectional relationship where cortical tau promotes atrophy in adjacent white matter.
