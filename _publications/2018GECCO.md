title: "Classification of resting-state fMRI for olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson&#39;s disease using evolutionary algorithms."
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018GECCO
excerpt: 'This paper develops automatic methods for detecting brain imaging preclinical biomarkers for olfactory dysfunction in early stage Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) by considering the novel application of evolutionary algorithms. Classification will be applied to PD patients with severe hyposmia, patients with no/mild hyposmia, and healthy controls.'
