This study examines the spatial patterns of amyloid-β and tau deposition in Vietnam War veterans with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The findings suggest that TBI is associated with distinct amyloid-β and tau deposition patterns, differing from those observed in typical Alzheimer's disease cases. These insights highlight the potential long-term neuropathological consequences of TBI and underscore the importance of tailored diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for affected individuals.
