This study examines how female sex influences the relationship between soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) and cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau (CSF p-tau) in Alzheimer's disease. The findings suggest that women may experience a stronger association between sTREM2-related microglial activation and tau pathology, highlighting the need for sex-specific considerations in therapeutic strategies.
