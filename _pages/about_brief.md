## Professional Experience

I am a machine learning/deep learning scientist with extensive experience in various research positions at prestigious institutions such as The Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich Medical Center, The University of York, The University of Aberdeen, and Trinity College Dublin. Additionally, I have worked in diverse biomedical companies, including roles as Chief Technology Officer at [ClearSky Medical Diagnostics Ltd.](https://www.clearskymd.com), machine learning and image processing engineer at [smartR.ai](https://smartr.ai), and Professional Engineer at My Therapy Tools Ltd. under the EU Horizon 2020 program.

## Research Focus

My research focuses on the application of machine learning/deep learning for analyzing biomedical data, including brain imaging, movement, and speech, for disease diagnosis and target identification. I lead the development of novel end-to-end analyses, particularly in diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, autism, and depression. At the LMU Hospital, I collaborate with [Dr. Franzmeier](https://www.isd-research.de/our-labs/franzmeier-lab/c2a419aceaa4aab7) on cutting-edge pre-processing and processing pipelines for multimodal brain imaging analysis.

## Collaborations

I have collaborated with renowned researchers such as [Prof. Smith](https://www.york.ac.uk/physics-engineering-technology/people/stephen_smith/), [Dr. Moriarty](https://www.york.ac.uk/institute-of-mental-health-research/our-members/staffmembers-sciences/andrewmoriarty/), [Dr. Paton](https://www.york.ac.uk/healthsciences/our-staff/lewis-paton/), and [Dr. Dutta](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arpan-Dutta-3) on projects focusing on objective assessment of depression from rsfMRI brain scans and investigating underlying mechanisms of rheumatoid arthritis-related fatigue in the brain. Additionally, I have contributed to projects analyzing speech and brain imaging features for the classification of Alzheimer’s disease patients and mild cognitive impairment.

## Education

I completed my doctoral thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Smith](https://www.york.ac.uk/physics-engineering-technology/people/stephen_smith/), focusing on the classification of resting state fMRI data and movement data for disease diagnosis. My research achievements include developing classification techniques and achieving high accuracy rates, such as 92% in classifying Parkinson’s disease patients from healthy controls.

I continuously strive to contribute to cutting-edge research in the field of machine learning and biomedical data analysis, with a focus on improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for various neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.
