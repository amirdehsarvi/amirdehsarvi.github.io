I am a Machine Learning Engineer & Data Scientist with expertise in AI-driven medical technologies, neuroimaging, and high-performance computing. I have extensive experience developing and optimizing ML/DL models for healthcare applications, with a strong background in Python, MATLAB, R, and deep learning frameworks. My work demonstrates a proven ability to build scalable data pipelines, automate complex workflows, and integrate AI solutions into real-world applications. I am passionate about leveraging data science and ML to drive innovation in health tech and beyond.

## Professional Experience

* **2022 to Date:** Postdoctoral Researcher, The Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research (ISD), Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU), University of Munich (Germany).
    * Developed and integrated an automated neuroimaging preprocessing pipeline (using Python, MATLAB, R, Shell) for multiple modalities (MRI, fMRI, PET, DTI) into the [GRIP platform](https://www.grip-research.org/platform), a Gates Ventures initiative, optimizing data quality and analysis. This pipeline's effectiveness is demonstrated by its use in over 25 peer-reviewed publications (2023-present) in neurodegenerative disease research.
    * Developed, validated, and deployed a deep learning model to infer full Alzheimer's disease A/T/N classification from single tau-PET scans, achieving high predictive accuracy for amyloid-PET (r=0.8) and MRI grey matter density (r=0.76).
    * In addition to my research, I manage the High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources and provide support to research labs for their data analysis needs on the HPC.
* **2018 to Date:** Chief Technology Officer, [ClearSky Medical Diagnostics Ltd.](https://www.clearskymd.com), York (UK).
    * Contributed to the development of machine learning (ML)-based medical devices for diagnosing and monitoring neurodegenerative conditions, including PD-Monitor, LID-Monitor, and MCI-Monitor.
    * Optimized ML for movement disorder analysis, enhancing diagnostic precision.
    * Collaborated with multidisciplinary teams, including clinicians and engineers, to integrate AI-driven solutions into clinical applications.
* **2021-2022:** Postdoctoral Research Associate, University of York (UK).
    * Applied white-box machine learning to resting-state fMRI data to differentiate depression from healthy controls.
* **2020-2021:** Research Fellow, University of Aberdeen (UK).
    * Used neuroimaging to define a fatigue-related brain network in rheumatoid arthritis, exploring how therapies impact it for potential DBS or similar targeting.
* **2021:** Machine Learning and Image Processing Engineer, [smartR.ai](https://smartr.ai), Edinburgh (UK).
    * Created deep learning pipelines to normalize and match color profiles between FIBI and H&E histological images.
* **2019:** Post-Doctoral Researcher in Neuroimaging, The University of Dublin (Ireland).
    * Linked speech patterns to brain volume changes in MCI/AD, exploring speech as an early marker of cognitive decline.
* **2016-2017:** Professional Engineer, My Therapy Tools Ltd.
    * Provided professional engineering support to a Horizon 2020 telerehabilitation platform development for brain injury patients.

## Research Focus

My research focuses on the application of machine learning/deep learning for analyzing biomedical data, including brain imaging, movement, and speech, for disease diagnosis and target identification. I lead the development of novel end-to-end analyses, particularly in diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, autism, and depression. At the LMU Hospital, I am working with [Dr. Franzmeier](https://www.isd-research.de/our-labs/franzmeier-lab/c2a419aceaa4aab7) on developing cutting-edge pre-processing and processing pipelines for multimodal brain imaging analysis (MRI, fMRI, PET, DTI, EEG, etc.).

## Collaborations

I have collaborated with renowned researchers such as [Prof. Smith](https://www.york.ac.uk/physics-engineering-technology/people/stephen_smith/), <a href="https://www.abdn.ac.uk/ims/people/profiles/g.waiter">Dr. Waiter</a>, <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/iii/staff/neilbasu/">Prof. Basu</a>, and <a href="https://reillylab.net/richard-reilly">Prof. Reilly</a> on multiple projects focusing on objective assessment of depression from rsfMRI brain scans, investigating underlying mechanisms of rheumatoid arthritis-related fatigue in the brain, and further, contributed to projects analyzing speech and brain imaging features for the classification of Alzheimer’s disease patients and mild cognitive impairment.

## Education

* **2014-2018:** PhD Electronic Engineering, University of York (UK).
    * Supervision: [Prof. Smith](https://www.york.ac.uk/physics-engineering-technology/people/stephen_smith/).
    * Thesis: Cartesian Genetic Programming Classification of Resting-State fMRI: Towards a Brain Imaging Biomarker for Parkinson's Disease.
* **2013:** MSc Digital Signal Processing, University of York (UK).
* **2010:** BSc Applied Science Electronics, University of Science and Arts of Yazd (Iran).
