I talked about an automated approach to the clinical monitoring of Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) by applying Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to resting-state functional magnetic imaging (rs-fMRI) data. The novel application of EAs to both map and predict the functional connectivity is considered in patients receiving the drug Modafinil versus placebo.
